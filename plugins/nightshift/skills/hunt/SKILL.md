description: Compose a guided or automatic shift from the ready catalog, then review it first or run it directly under one time budget. Use when the owner wants to choose jobs or let Nightshift find the highest-value applicable work.
---

Compose a shift for the host-opened project.

Resolve the host-opened project folder to an absolute `$TASK_ROOT`: use `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}` on
Claude Code; on Codex honor Nightshift's `${CODEX_PROJECT_DIR}` recovery override when present,
otherwise capture `pwd -P` before any other shell call. Resolve `$TASK_ROOT/.nightshift-link` when
present and call the validated absolute target `$NIGHTSHIFT_WORKSPACE`; otherwise set
`NIGHTSHIFT_WORKSPACE="$TASK_ROOT"`.

Bind the Nightshift directory once: `NS="$NIGHTSHIFT_WORKSPACE/.nightshift"`. On native Windows,
`$NS = Join-Path $NIGHTSHIFT_WORKSPACE '.nightshift'`. After this bind, Nightshift files are
`$NS/<name>` for every read, write, and shell command. Catalog and owner-facing prose may use the
short names (`punch-list.md`, `parking-lot.md`, `STOP`). Never re-resolve. Helpers that take
`--project` or `-Project` still receive `"$NIGHTSHIFT_WORKSPACE"`.
Never search or guess. The shell's working directory persists
between Bash calls, so never use a bare path. If `$NS/` does not
exist yet, tell the user to run Setup, then return.

**State map:** `punch-list.md` → owner-approved work active in this shift;
`drafting-table.md` → known work staged for a later shift; `parking-lot.md` → unresolved owner
decisions plus the default chosen so work continues; `work-orders.md` → timed catalog work composed
only through Hunt. Ordinary known plans never become work orders.

Resolve the installed plugin root to an absolute `$NIGHTSHIFT_PLUGIN_ROOT`: use
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` on Claude Code; on Codex use `$PLUGIN_ROOT` when available, otherwise derive
it from the absolute path attached to this skill (`skills/hunt/SKILL.md`). Substitute that absolute
path below; never search for the plugin.

Read `$NIGHTSHIFT_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/nightshift/references/execution-modes.md` before composing
work. It is the shared contract for who selects work, when the clock starts, direct-mode authority,
and how multiple entries become one shift.

## 1. Ask who selects

Entries live one per file in `$NIGHTSHIFT_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/nightshift/references/shifts/`.
**List that directory and read every file in it**. `shift-catalog.md` beside it explains the two
endings; it does not list the entries.

Offer two first-class modes:

- **Guided** — show one offer line per entry, with its ending marked. The owner may choose more
 than one.
- **Automatic** — ask for hours, inspect the project, determine which entries apply, deduplicate
 their findings, and rank them using `execution-modes.md`. Show evidence only in review-first
 mode; run-direct does not pause.
**More than one may be chosen** — a night can clear the lint backlog and then hunt coverage until
the whistle. Respect every entry's compatibility restrictions when composing a combination; never
combine entries that claim the same single-writer state.

Read the directory rather than reciting from memory: entries are added over time, and a job that
exists in the folder but not in the offer is a job the owner never gets.

The GitHub issue-hunt entry is offered with the rest of the catalog. It consumes only
drafting-table entries created by the Import issues skill (canonical Source URL and
`Status: proposed`). List them with
`"$NIGHTSHIFT_PLUGIN_ROOT/runtime/import-issues.sh" --project "$NIGHTSHIFT_WORKSPACE" --list-proposed`
(on native Windows, `& "$NIGHTSHIFT_PLUGIN_ROOT\runtime\windows\import-issues.ps1" -Project "$NIGHTSHIFT_WORKSPACE" -ListProposed`)
and move a selection with the same qualified helper plus `--promote` / `-Promote` — a cut, never a copy. It
does not replace defect hunt or product evolution, and it never searches GitHub or writes back to
it.

## 2. Ask when execution starts

Ask **review first, or run directly?** This choice is independent from Guided or Automatic.

- In **review first**, all discovery remains read-only and the clock starts only after approval.
- In **run directly**, start the clock immediately and do not pause after discovery. Follow the
 direct-mode decision policy in `execution-modes.md`.

## 3. Establish the ending

Per the entry's declared ending:

- **Open-ended** — hours are REQUIRED. These have no natural end but the clock; a walkthrough may
 not start without a deadline. The entry's declared open-ended title is the source of truth.
- **Finite** — ask the ending as an explicit either/or: *until every finding
 is clear, or capped at N hours?* Both are valid answers; the work ends when the list is empty
 either way, and hours are only a safeguard against a backlog bigger than the night.

One deadline governs the whole shift. Automatic mode always requires hours. On a mixed selection
say so plainly in one line: the finite
work runs first, and the open-ended job soaks up whatever time is left.

## 4. Ask for guided scope

> Anything specific about scope or approach?

Ask this in Guided mode. In Automatic mode infer the safest valuable scope from evidence and the
time budget. Free text is skippable. It is where the useful shift is made: *"only `packages/api/`"*, *"use
`getTestInstance()` from the test package"*, *"one module — this becomes a single reviewable PR"*.
If a selected entry declares Owner instructions required, free text is not skippable: ask for it
and refuse to compose, cut, or arm that entry until the owner supplies a non-empty answer. Entries
that require owner instructions are Guided-only and must never be selected in Automatic mode.
Never edit the entry's own contract to fit it; the owner's words become their own sub-bullet:

```text
 - **Owner instructions:** <verbatim, as written>
```

The entry's rules stay above it untouched. They enforce the shift contract — assert behaviour
rather than counts, gate green at every commit, never silence instead of fixing — and owner text
adds constraints rather than replacing them.

## 5. Review or cut

In **review first**, print the items exactly as they will be written, with evidence, order, hours,
and ending, then ask for one approval. This is the last look before anything is armed. Write
nothing before approval.

In **run directly**, do not ask again: write the order and immediately cut it into the active shift.
Record significant discovery and selection decisions in
`$NS/parking-lot.md` as required by the shared
mode contract.

On approval, append to `$NS/work-orders.md` — hunt's own file; the drafting table stays the
owner's room. Never clobber orders already sitting there — append below them:

```text
## Work order — <ISO date time>
Hours: <N, or "none — finite">

- [ ] **<entry item, verbatim>**
 - **Owner instructions:** <if any>
```

The hours are inert while a review-first order sits here — the clock starts only at the cut, after
approval. In run-direct mode the order is cut immediately, so its clock starts now.

## 6. Start or park after review

After review-first approval, ask **start now, or park it for later?** Run-direct skips this question
and always starts now; choosing it was already explicit authorization.

On **now** — start the shift yourself, here, without making the owner type another command. Follow
the Start skill exactly: clear the stale markers, **cut** the whole `## Work order` section
out of `$NS/work-orders.md` (heading, hours, and item — do not leave an empty
order heading behind), put only the item under `## Items` in the punch list (a cut, never a
copy — it must not exist in two places), write
`$NS/deadline` from the recorded hours, **arm the gate** with
`touch "$NS/.shift-armed"` on POSIX, or
`New-Item -ItemType File -Force "$NS\.shift-armed"` in native
Windows PowerShell, log the start, and arm the watchman as the Start skill
requires. Claude Code uses
`$NIGHTSHIFT_PLUGIN_ROOT/runtime/claude/watchman.sh`; Codex uses
`$NIGHTSHIFT_PLUGIN_ROOT/runtime/codex/watchman.sh`; native Windows uses
`& "$NIGHTSHIFT_PLUGIN_ROOT\runtime\windows\start-watchman.ps1"`
`-Project "$NIGHTSHIFT_WORKSPACE" -HostName claude` (Codex: `-HostName codex`).
The marker is what starts the shift — without it the list is written and nothing is holding it. From
that second the gate holds this session until the list is done, a stop-work order lands, or the
whistle blows. An empty `## Items` section still keeps the Shift contract and Gates; they bind
the cut item. Record leftover campaign rules in `$NS/parking-lot.md` when they are not this
order's.

On **later** — the order stays parked in `$NS/work-orders.md` with its hours, costing nothing. It arms
nothing and the gate stays inert. Start (`/nightshift:start` on Claude Code, or ask Nightshift to
start on Codex) will offer it when the owner is ready.
