# Dead-code cleanup — finite — code proven unused by tooling the repository already trusts

Unused exports, files, branches, or dependencies reported by analyzers and build tools already in
the project. Each deletion carries evidence; dynamic or uncertain references stay untouched.

Use only when the repository already has a dead-code, unused-export, dependency, compiler, or
coverage tool capable of producing findings. Supported stacks are whatever that configured tool
supports. If no such tool is configured, this shift is unsupported and must not start.

```text
- [ ] **Dead-code cleanup — remove only code the project's existing tooling proves unused.**
  - Discovery: detect and run the repository's configured unused-code tooling, compiler checks, or
    dependency analyzer. Record its exact command and findings; dedupe against snag-log.md (ALL
    seen — fixed and rejected). Do not introduce a new analyzer without owner approval.
  - Take one coherent finding at a time. Confirm it is not reached through reflection, dynamic
    imports, registration, configuration, generated code, public exports, or external consumers.
    Remove it, run the item gate and the original analyzer, commit.
  - Park uncertain findings in snag-log.md with the analyzer evidence and the reference that could
    not be ruled out. Uncertainty is not permission to delete.
  - Never infer dead code from intuition, naming, low coverage, or a text search alone.
  - Never delete a public API, migration, plugin entry point, compatibility shim, or generated
    artifact merely because the local analyzer cannot see its consumer.
  - Never add ignore rules or weaken the analyzer to make its report clean.
  - Ends when the original analyzer reports no actionable findings, and every uncertain or
    externally consumed finding is parked with its evidence and reason.
  - Verify: the item gate is green at every commit; the existing dead-code analyzer is rerun after
    every deletion and the final repository build or package check succeeds.
