# Vocabulary

Everything is named from a real construction site — learn one term, guess the rest:

| Term | File / mechanism | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **punch list** | `.nightshift/punch-list.md` | construction's final acceptance list — the job isn't done until every item is cleared and signed off |
| **clock-out gate** | Stop hook | you can't clock out while the punch list has open items |
| **hardhat** | PreToolUse hook | mandatory safety equipment — your forbidden commands, protected dirs, secret patterns; denied, not discouraged |
| **item gate** | per-item commands | work isn't accepted until it passes inspection — once per item, right before its commit |
| **site inspection** | interval commands | the scheduled heavy inspection (coverage, dead code, Sonar) every N items or H hours |
| **walkthrough** | template item | the open-ended scan → fix loop that hunts defects until the clock runs out |
| **hunt** | `/nightshift:hunt` | writes a ready-made walkthrough as a work order; cuts it into the punch list only on your word |
| **work order** | `.nightshift/work-orders.md` | a prepared job ticket — the item plus its hours, clock not running until the cut |
| **snag log** | `.nightshift/snag-log.md` | findings ledger across runs — cycle 4 never re-reports cycle 1 |
| **product research** | `.nightshift/product-research.md` | dated evidence about the product, users, comparable tools, and unmet needs; conclusions keep their source links |
| **opportunity map** | `.nightshift/opportunity-map.md` | ranked product opportunities with evidence, value, differentiation, effort, reversibility, risk, and an honest status; its single `building` entry is the resumable current cycle |
| **parking lot** | `.nightshift/parking-lot.md` | decisions for the human — parked with a default chosen, the run continues |
| **park, don't ask** | hardhat rule | during a shift the ask-tool is denied — the question is parked with a default chosen; answer mid-run in the session and the agent applies it |
| **quality survey** | `/nightshift:quality` | the optional debt audit — existing lint/type findings become proposed items; accept, edit, or decline |
| **drafting table** | `.nightshift/drafting-table.md` | where items are drawn before they're contracted |
| **quitting time** | `.nightshift/deadline` | past the deadline, the next stop attempt clocks the shift out and starts nothing new — a whistle, not an axe: it bounds the night without killing work mid-item |
| **red-tag** | stall guard | a stuck run is flagged in the shift log and held open by default; `NIGHTSHIFT_STALL_MAX=N` clocks it out after N stuck attempts instead |
| **stop-work order** | `.nightshift/STOP` | `/nightshift:stop` — or `touch .nightshift/STOP` from any terminal — ends the shift at the agent's next stop attempt; the site rules stay armed until it actually stops |
| **morning whistle** | `NIGHTSHIFT_NOTIFY_CMD` | optional shift-end ping (ntfy / Pushover / `say`) |
| **night watchman** | `plugins/nightshift/runtime/claude/watchman.sh` | one per host (`runtime/claude/`, `runtime/codex/`) — revives a session that DIED mid-shift (crash, API outage) by resuming its own conversation; stands down at every honest ending |
